compare with script and programming :-
------------------------------------------------
script :-
1.weekly or loosly typed programming.
2.scripting interpreter .
​
​
​
​
programming:-
1.strickly typed & syntax based.
2.compiler based.
​
Compiler & interpreter:-
-------------------------------------------
​
program we are going to write it will be in the human readable langauage but system cannot understand the 
human reable lang our system can understand only binary langauage.
​
example :-java
 
compiler :- it will check the syntax & it will convert the .java file into .class file.
​
Interpreter :- It will check line by line and it will convert .class file into bit formates
​
              (binary ----0101) 
​
What is shell :-
---------------------------------------
shell is special user program which provide an interface to user to use operating system services ,
shell accept human readble commands from user and convert into something which kernal can understand.
it is a command lang intrepreter that execute commands read from input devices such as keyboard or from files
the shell gets started when the user logs or start the terminal..
​
scenarios :-
-----------------------------------------
1. why we need to use shell scripting :-
​
​
VTU ---- given me one task that i need to creat a directory for specific colleges and i need to add the 
         teaching staff , non teaching staff & students which belongs different different branches .
​
500 eng & 200 MBA colleges & MTECH 50 , MCA 50
​
insted of writing the commands what i will do i will create one script 
​
ex :- #!/bin/bash
       
       mkdir college
       read 
​
       touch file
       
​
commands :-
---------------------
1.mkdir :- we are going to create the directory.
2.touch :- we are going to create the files.(branches, teaching staff, non teaching staff)
3.vi/nano editors we are going to add the information..
​
​
sceanrios 2:-
-------------------------------------------
consider As a system admin we will working  manger will give one task we need to install the tomcat in
one system & we need enable the tomcat 
​
task :-
-------------------
yum update ----we need wait to complte this task
yum install tomcat ----we need wait to complte this task
systemctl start tomcat ----we need wait to complte this task
​
​
50 systems i need perform this task in a single day
​
i will one script :- 
​
yum update ---- no need wait to complte this task
yum install tomcat ---- no need wait to complte this task
systemctl start tomcat ---- no need wait to complte this task.
​
​
created one script :-
-----------------------------
step 1:- create one file with the extension of .sh
step 2 :- open the editor 
​
         #!/bin/bash
​
step 3 :- execute by 
​
   sh filename.sh
​
Variables :-
---------------------------------
def :- variable is a named memory location which is used to store the data & it can change n times during 
       execution.
​
example :- a=10, b=skillrary 
10 is stored in a means the value of a is 10 know 
​
the value of b is skillrary 
​
example for script :-
----------------------
​
#!/bin/bash
​
x=20
echo $x
​
​
Varaible we will be having 3 types :-
---------------------------------------
1.user defined varaibles :- The user is going to create the varaible (assign ) 
​
​
​
2.system defined varaibles :- already system will be having some varaibles
​
examples :- echo $HOME
            echo $OSTYPE
            echo $PATH 
​
​
​
​
3.environment varaibles :- 
​
examples :-printenv
set
​
Read only varaibles :-
------------------------------------
After a varaible is marked Read-only its value cannot be changged 
​
a=20
readonly a
​
unset this value it will not change 
​
Unset :-
----------------
We are going unset the value  
​
example :- 
#!/bin/bash
a=20
unset a
a=15
echo the value of a is $a
​
output:-
--------------
the value of a is 15
         
​
